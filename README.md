(Pronounced like: Co-dear-is)

An experimental, new firmware for the Cosmo Commuicator's external display,
written in Rust. It is **not** a drop-in replacement.

The firmware aims to be a microkernel RTOS (Real-time Operating System), as to
efficiently run on limited processing power.

Please see [here][design_notes] for the design notes, and note that
this project is in its infancy.
