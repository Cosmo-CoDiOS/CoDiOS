## About

An experimental, new firmware for the Cosmo Commuicator's external display,
written in Rust.

The firmware's aims are to be fast, battery/processor efficient, and minimal (in terms of UI/UX features).

Stock CoDi from Planet Computers has tried to fit too much into the firmware, 
and therefore adds complexity, and slowness. It also uses a proprietary 
graphics library, as well as being proprietary itself. CoDiOS will be a true 
open-source firmware, with ways for the Planet community to contribute and shape 
the future of CoDiOS.

Please see [here][design_notes] for the design notes, and note that
this project is in its infancy.
